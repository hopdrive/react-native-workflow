## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
npm install react-native-workflow react-native-mmkv
# or
yarn add react-native-workflow react-native-mmkv
```

### Define an Activity

Activities are the building blocks—small, restartable units of work:

```typescript
// activities/uploadPhoto.ts
import { defineActivity, conditions } from 'react-native-workflow';

export const uploadPhoto = defineActivity({
  name: 'uploadPhoto',

  execute: async (ctx) => {
    const { uri } = ctx.input;
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/upload', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: createFormData(uri),
      signal: ctx.signal, // Supports cancellation
    });
    return { s3Key: response.key };
  },

  options: {
    startToCloseTimeout: 60000,
    retry: { maximumAttempts: 5 },
    runWhen: conditions.whenConnected,
  },
});
```

### Define a Workflow

Workflows compose activities into a sequence:

```typescript
// workflows/photo.ts
import { defineWorkflow } from 'react-native-workflow';
import { capturePhoto, uploadPhoto, notifyServer } from './activities';

export const photoWorkflow = defineWorkflow({
  name: 'photo',
  activities: [capturePhoto, uploadPhoto, notifyServer],

  onComplete: async (runId, finalState) => {
    console.log('Photo synced!', finalState.s3Key);
  },
});
```

### Start the Engine

```typescript
// App.tsx
import { WorkflowEngine, MMKVStorageAdapter } from 'react-native-workflow';
import { photoWorkflow } from './workflows/photo';

const engine = await WorkflowEngine.create({
  storage: new MMKVStorageAdapter(),
  runtimeContext: () => ({
    isConnected: NetInfo.isConnected(),
  }),
});

engine.registerWorkflow(photoWorkflow);
engine.start();

// Start a workflow
const execution = await engine.start(photoWorkflow, {
  input: { moveId: 123, uri: 'file://photo.jpg' },
});
console.log('Started workflow:', execution.runId);
```

That's it! The workflow will:
- Persist across app restarts
- Retry failed activities with backoff
- Wait for network before upload activities
- Track progress through each stage

---

## Why This Exists

Mobile applications operating in unreliable network conditions need a way to:

- **Execute multi-step business processes reliably** — A photo upload isn't just "upload a file"—it's capture, process, upload, notify server, and cleanup. If step 3 fails, you don't want to redo steps 1-2.

- **Persist work across app restarts and crashes** — A driver taking delivery photos shouldn't lose work because the app was killed in the background.

- **Handle retries with configurable backoff strategies** — When a network request fails, retry intelligently rather than hammering the server.

- **Defer execution until preconditions are met** — Don't attempt uploads when offline. Wait for WiFi for large files. Respect rate limits.

- **Track progress through complex workflows** — Know exactly which step you're on and what remains.

- **Process work in the background within OS constraints** — iOS and Android limit background execution to ~30 seconds. Work must be structured accordingly.

### Design Goals

1. **Offline-first**: All state persisted locally; network is optional
2. **Durable execution**: Workflows survive app crashes and device restarts
3. **Simple mental model**: Familiar patterns from industry-standard workflow engines
4. **React-friendly**: First-class hooks for UI integration
5. **Minimal footprint**: Lightweight enough for mobile constraints
6. **Storage-agnostic**: Pluggable persistence layer (MMKV, SQLite, Realm)

---

## Origin Story

This project evolved from real-world experience building offline-first mobile applications at [HopDrive](https://hopdrive.com), a vehicle logistics platform where drivers need to complete deliveries regardless of network conditions.

### The Original: react-native-queue

We started with [billmalarky/react-native-queue](https://github.com/billmalarky/react-native-queue), an excellent Realm-backed job queue library. However, the original was abandoned in 2018 and lacked features critical for our use case.

### The HopDrive Fork

We created and actively maintain [@hopdrive/react-native-queue](https://github.com/hopdrive/react-native-queue), adding several production-critical features:

| Feature | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `isJobRunnable` | Conditional execution—don't run network jobs when offline |
| `minimumMillisBetweenAttempts` | Rate limiting—prevent retry storms during flaky connectivity |
| `onSkipped` callback | Observability—know why jobs aren't running |
| `failureBehavior: 'custom'` | Flexible retry logic beyond simple attempt counts |
| Lifespan-based execution | Background task support within OS time limits |

### The Pipeline Pattern

On top of the queue, we built a "pipeline" pattern for multi-stage workflows:

```typescript
// Old HopDrive pattern
const photoPipeline = {
  name: 'photo.pipeline',
  sequence: [PhotoCapture, PhotoPending, PhotoUpload, PhotoSave],
};

// Starting a pipeline created an "Event" record and enqueued the first job
await startPhotoPipeline({ payload: { moveId, uri } });

// Each worker called completeStage() to advance
export const worker = async (id, payload) => {
  await doWork(payload);
  await EventUtils.completeStage(pipeline, payload.eventId, { result });
};
```

This worked well but had problems:

1. **Confusing terminology** — "Events" weren't events (immutable facts), they were mutable execution records. "Pipelines" suggested data transformation rather than workflows.

2. **Manual stage advancement** — Every worker had to remember to call `completeStage()`. Miss it and your workflow stalled silently.

3. **Tight coupling to Realm** — The Event tracking system was hardcoded to Realm, making migration difficult as Realm's maintenance status became uncertain.

4. **Application-layer complexity** — The pipeline logic lived in our app, not a reusable library. Every new pipeline required boilerplate.

### Why We Built This

We needed to:

1. **Migrate from Realm to MMKV** — Realm's future is uncertain; MMKV is simpler and actively maintained.

2. **Align with industry standards** — Temporal is the gold standard for workflow orchestration. Borrowing its terminology and patterns means developers can transfer knowledge.

3. **Extract the pattern into a library** — What we built was useful. Others face the same challenges.

4. **Simplify the mental model** — Automatic stage advancement, clear terminology, explicit state threading.

### What Changed

| Old (HopDrive App) | New (This Library) | Why |
|--------------------|-------------------|-----|
| Pipeline | Workflow | Industry-standard term for business process |
| Event | WorkflowExecution | Events should be immutable; executions are mutable |
| eventId | runId | Matches Temporal terminology |
| Job | ActivityTask (internal) | Users don't interact with internal task records |
| Worker | Activity | Matches Temporal; cleaner separation |
| `completeStage()` | *(automatic)* | Less error-prone; activities just return results |

---

## Relationship to Temporal

This system is inspired by [Temporal's](https://temporal.io) conceptual model but simplified for mobile constraints. If you know Temporal, you'll feel at home. If you don't, that's fine—the concepts stand on their own.

### Terminology Mapping

| This System | Temporal Equivalent | Notes |
|-------------|---------------------|-------|
| Workflow | Workflow | Exact match |
| WorkflowExecution | Workflow Execution | Exact match |
| Activity | Activity | Exact match |
| ActivityOptions | Activity Options | Exact match |
| runId | Run ID | Exact match |
| uniqueKey | Workflow ID | Similar deduplication purpose |
| runWhen | *(no equivalent)* | Mobile-specific for offline/conditions |
| WorkflowEngine | Worker + Client | Combined since single-process on mobile |

### Features We Intentionally Omit

Temporal is a powerful distributed system. We're building for mobile, which has different constraints:

- **Signals** — Send data to a running workflow from outside. On mobile, you can just pass data through the next activity.

- **Queries** — Read workflow state without affecting it. Use React hooks to observe state instead.

- **Child Workflows** — Workflows spawning sub-workflows. Keep it simple; compose at the activity level.

- **Continue-As-New** — Long-running workflow pagination. Mobile workflows are typically short-lived.

- **Deterministic Replay** — Temporal's core durability mechanism. We use simpler crash recovery (re-run interrupted activities).

- **Versioning** — Handling workflow definition changes mid-execution. Not implementing in v1.

- **Task Queues** — Routing/load-balancing across workers. Single-process on mobile.

### The Key Insight

Temporal's power comes from deterministic replay—recording every decision and replaying them exactly. This requires activities to be pure (no side effects) and workflows to be deterministic.

We take a simpler approach: **activities are small, idempotent, and restartable**. If an activity crashes, restart it from the beginning. This works because we design activities to be safe to re-run.

---

## Design Philosophy

### Small, Idempotent, Restartable Activities

The fundamental principle is that **activities should be the smallest unit of work that can be safely retried**.

When an activity is interrupted (app crash, device reboot, user force-quit), the system has two choices:
1. Resume from where it left off (requires checkpointing)
2. Restart the activity from the beginning

This system chooses **restart from the beginning**. This is simpler, more predictable, and avoids complex state management. But it only works if activities are designed correctly.

### Activity Design Guidelines

**DO: Break work into small, atomic activities**

```typescript
// Good: Each step is its own activity
const photoWorkflow = defineWorkflow({
  name: 'photo',
  activities: [
    preparePhoto,      // Validate, generate metadata
    uploadPhoto,       // Upload to S3
    notifyServer,      // Tell backend about the upload
    cleanupLocal,      // Delete local file
  ],
});
```

**DON'T: Combine non-idempotent operations**

```typescript
// Bad: If this crashes after charging but before saving receipt,
// restarting will charge the card again!
execute: async (ctx) => {
  await chargeCard(ctx.input.amount);      // Side effect!
  await saveReceipt(ctx.input.orderId);    // If we crash here...
  return { charged: true };
}
```

**DO: Design for idempotency**

```typescript
// Good: Check if already done, use idempotency keys
execute: async (ctx) => {
  const { orderId, idempotencyKey } = ctx.input;

  // Check if already charged
  const existing = await getCharge(orderId);
  if (existing) return { chargeId: existing.id };

  // Charge with idempotency key (Stripe will dedupe)
  const charge = await stripe.charges.create({
    amount: ctx.input.amount,
    idempotency_key: idempotencyKey,
  });

  return { chargeId: charge.id };
}
```

### The Checkpoint Test

Ask yourself: "If this activity crashes at any line and restarts from the beginning, what happens?"

- ✅ **Safe**: Re-uploading the same file to S3 (overwrites with same content)
- ✅ **Safe**: Re-sending an API request with an idempotency key
- ✅ **Safe**: Re-reading data and re-computing a result
- ❌ **Unsafe**: Incrementing a counter without checking current value
- ❌ **Unsafe**: Sending a notification without checking if already sent
- ❌ **Unsafe**: Any mutation without idempotency protection

### When You Need Checkpoints

If you find yourself wanting mid-activity checkpoints, that's a signal to split into multiple activities:

```typescript
// Before: One big activity with implicit checkpoints
execute: async (ctx) => {
  const processed = await processImages(ctx.input.images);  // 30 seconds
  // "checkpoint" - what if we crash here?
  const uploaded = await uploadAll(processed);               // 60 seconds
  // "checkpoint" - what if we crash here?
  await notifyServer(uploaded);                              // 5 seconds
}

// After: Three activities, each restartable
const processImages = defineActivity({ /* ... */ });   // Can restart safely
const uploadImages = defineActivity({ /* ... */ });    // Can restart safely
const notifyServer = defineActivity({ /* ... */ });    // Can restart safely
```

### Crash Recovery Behavior

When the engine starts, it checks for activities left in `active` status (indicating a crash during execution):

```typescript
// On engine startup
const abandonedActivities = await storage.getActivitiesByStatus('active');
for (const activity of abandonedActivities) {
  // Reset to pending - will be picked up and restarted
  activity.status = 'pending';
  activity.attempts += 1;  // Count the crashed attempt
  await storage.saveActivity(activity);
}
```

This is safe **only if activities follow the design guidelines above**.

## Core Concepts

### Workflows

A **Workflow** is a definition—a blueprint for a business process. It specifies a unique name, an ordered sequence of activities, and optional lifecycle callbacks.

```typescript
interface Workflow<TInput = any> {
  name: string;
  activities: Activity[];
  onComplete?: (runId: string, finalState: object) => Promise<void>;
  onFailed?: (runId: string, state: object, error: Error) => Promise<void>;
  onCancelled?: (runId: string, state: object) => Promise<void>;
}
```

A workflow definition is **static**—it doesn't change at runtime. Think of it like a class definition.

```typescript
const photoWorkflow = defineWorkflow({
  name: 'photo',
  activities: [capturePhoto, uploadPhoto, notifyServer],

  onComplete: async (runId, finalState) => {
    console.log(`Photo workflow ${runId} completed`);
  },

  onFailed: async (runId, state, error) => {
    await notifyUserOfFailure(state.moveId);
  },
});
```

### WorkflowExecutions

A **WorkflowExecution** is an instance—a specific execution of a workflow. It tracks current position in the activity sequence, accumulated state, status, and timestamps.

```typescript
interface WorkflowExecution {
  runId: string;                     // Unique identifier
  workflowName: string;              // References workflow definition
  uniqueKey?: string;                // Optional deduplication key
  currentActivityIndex: number;      // Position in activity sequence
  currentActivityName: string;       // Name of current/next activity
  status: 'running' | 'completed' | 'failed' | 'cancelled';
  input: object;                     // Original input when started
  state: object;                     // Accumulated state
  createdAt: number;
  updatedAt: number;
  completedAt?: number;
  error?: string;
  failedActivityName?: string;
}
```

A workflow execution is **mutable**—it changes as activities complete. Think of it like a class instance.

### Activities

An **Activity** is a function definition that does actual work. Activities are pure async functions that receive input and return output, configured with options for timeout, retry, and conditions, and independently testable with no framework dependencies.

```typescript
interface Activity<TInput = any, TOutput = any> {
  name: string;
  execute: (ctx: ActivityContext<TInput>) => Promise<TOutput>;
  options?: ActivityOptions;
}
```

```typescript
const uploadPhoto = defineActivity({
  name: 'uploadPhoto',

  execute: async (ctx) => {
    const { uri, hash } = ctx.input;
    const response = await uploadToS3(uri, { signal: ctx.signal });
    return { s3Key: response.key, uploadedAt: Date.now() };
  },

  options: {
    startToCloseTimeout: 60000,
    retry: { maximumAttempts: 10 },
    runWhen: conditions.whenConnected,
  },
});
```

### ActivityTasks (Internal)

An **ActivityTask** is a persisted record representing a scheduled activity execution. Users don't interact with these directly—they're internal to the engine.

```typescript
interface ActivityTask {
  taskId: string;
  runId: string;
  activityName: string;
  status: 'pending' | 'active' | 'completed' | 'failed' | 'skipped';
  input: object;
  result?: object;
  priority: number;
  attempts: number;
  maxAttempts: number;
  timeout: number;
  createdAt: number;
  scheduledFor?: number;      // For backoff delays
  startedAt?: number;
  lastAttemptAt?: number;
  completedAt?: number;
  error?: string;
  errorStack?: string;
}
```

### Terminology Reference

## API Reference

### WorkflowEngine

The main orchestrator for workflow execution:

```typescript
import { WorkflowEngine, MMKVStorageAdapter } from 'react-native-workflow';

// Initialize the engine
const engine = await WorkflowEngine.create({
  storage: new MMKVStorageAdapter(),

  // Runtime context provider (called for each activity)
  runtimeContext: () => ({
    isConnected: getNetworkState(),
    batteryLevel: getBatteryLevel(),
    // Add app-specific context values
  }),

  // Optional event handlers
  onExecutionStateChanged: (execution) => { /* ... */ },
  onActivityTaskStateChanged: (task) => { /* ... */ },
});

// Register workflows (typically at app startup)
engine.registerWorkflow(photoWorkflow);
engine.registerWorkflow(driverStatusSyncWorkflow);

// Start a workflow execution
const execution = await engine.start(photoWorkflow, {
  input: { moveId: 123, uri: 'file://photo.jpg' },
});

// Start with uniqueness constraint (deduplication)
const execution = await engine.start(driverStatusSyncWorkflow, {
  input: { driverId: 456 },
  uniqueKey: `driver-sync:${driverId}`,
});

// Handle uniqueness conflicts
try {
  await engine.start(workflow, { input, uniqueKey });
} catch (err) {
  if (err instanceof UniqueConstraintError) {
    console.log('Sync already in progress:', err.existingRunId);
  }
}

// Or ignore conflicts (return existing execution)
const execution = await engine.start(workflow, {
  input,
  uniqueKey,
  onConflict: 'ignore',  // Returns existing execution instead of throwing
});

// Query executions
const execution = await engine.getExecution(runId);
const running = await engine.getExecutionsByStatus('running');

// Control execution
await engine.cancelExecution(runId);
await engine.retryExecution(runId);  // Retry from failed activity

// Engine control
engine.start();                      // Begin processing activities
engine.start({ lifespan: 25000 });   // Process for max 25 seconds (background mode)
engine.stop();                       // Pause processing

// Dead letter queue
const deadLetters = await engine.getDeadLetters();
const unacked = await engine.getUnacknowledgedDeadLetters();
await engine.acknowledgeDeadLetter(id);
await engine.purgeDeadLetters({ olderThanMs: 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 });
```

### defineWorkflow

Create a workflow definition:

```typescript
import { defineWorkflow } from 'react-native-workflow';

export const photoWorkflow = defineWorkflow<PhotoWorkflowInput>({
  name: 'photo',

  activities: [capturePhoto, uploadPhoto, notifyServer],

  onComplete: async (runId, finalState) => {
    console.log(`Workflow ${runId} completed with state:`, finalState);
  },

  onFailed: async (runId, state, error) => {
    console.error(`Workflow ${runId} failed:`, error.message);
  },

  onCancelled: async (runId, state) => {
    console.log(`Workflow ${runId} cancelled`);
  },
});

interface PhotoWorkflowInput {
  moveId: number;
  uri: string;
  workflowType?: string;
}
```

### defineActivity

Create an activity definition:

```typescript
import { defineActivity } from 'react-native-workflow';

export const uploadPhoto = defineActivity<UploadInput, UploadOutput>({
  name: 'uploadPhoto',

  execute: async (ctx) => {
    const { uri, hash } = ctx.input;
    const response = await uploadToS3(uri, { signal: ctx.signal });
    return { s3Key: response.key, uploadedAt: Date.now() };
  },

  options: {
    startToCloseTimeout: 60000,
    retry: {
      maximumAttempts: 10,
      initialInterval: 5000,
      backoffCoefficient: 2,
      maximumInterval: 60000,
    },
    priority: 50,
    runWhen: conditions.whenConnected,

    // Lifecycle callbacks
    onStart: async (taskId, input) => { },
    onSuccess: async (taskId, input, result) => { },
    onFailure: async (taskId, input, error, attempt) => { },
    onFailed: async (taskId, input, error) => { },
    onSkipped: async (taskId, input, reason) => { },
  },
});

interface UploadInput {
  uri: string;
  hash: string;
}

interface UploadOutput {
  s3Key: string;
  uploadedAt: number;
}
```

### ActivityContext

The context object passed to activity execute functions:

```typescript
interface ActivityContext<TInput = any> {
  // Identity
  runId: string;                    // Workflow execution ID
  taskId: string;                   // This activity task's ID
  attempt: number;                  // Current attempt number (1-based)

  // Data
  input: TInput;                    // Accumulated workflow state

  // Cancellation
  signal: AbortSignal;              // Fires on cancel or timeout

  // Runtime context (from engine configuration)
  isConnected: boolean;
  batteryLevel?: number;
  [key: string]: any;               // App-specific values

  // Utilities
  log: (...args: any[]) => void;    // Contextual logging
}
```

---

## Activity Configuration

### ActivityOptions Reference

```typescript
interface ActivityOptions {
  // === TIMEOUTS ===
  startToCloseTimeout?: number;     // Ms before activity times out (default: 25000)

  // === RETRY POLICY ===
  retry?: {
    maximumAttempts?: number;       // Max attempts before failing (default: 1)
    initialInterval?: number;       // First retry delay in ms (default: 1000)
    backoffCoefficient?: number;    // Multiplier for each retry (default: 2)
    maximumInterval?: number;       // Cap on retry delay (default: none)
  };

  // === PRIORITY ===
  priority?: number;                // Higher = processed first (default: 0)

  // === CONDITIONAL EXECUTION ===
  runWhen?: RunCondition | ((ctx: RuntimeContext) => RunConditionResult);

  // === LIFECYCLE CALLBACKS ===
  onStart?: (taskId: string, input: object) => Promise<void>;
  onSuccess?: (taskId: string, input: object, result: object) => Promise<void>;
  onFailure?: (taskId: string, input: object, error: Error, attempt: number) => Promise<void>;
  onFailed?: (taskId: string, input: object, error: Error) => Promise<void>;
  onSkipped?: (taskId: string, input: object, reason: string) => Promise<void>;
}

interface RunConditionResult {
  ready: boolean;
  reason?: string;                  // Passed to onSkipped if not ready
  retryInMs?: number;               // Hint for when to check again
}
```

### Built-in Conditions

```typescript
import { conditions } from 'react-native-workflow';

// Simple conditions
conditions.always                   // Always ready (default)
conditions.whenConnected            // Ready when ctx.isConnected === true
conditions.whenDisconnected         // Ready when offline (for offline-only work)

// Time-based
conditions.afterDelay(ms)           // Ready after activity pending for N ms

// Combinators
conditions.all(cond1, cond2)        // Ready when ALL conditions are ready
conditions.any(cond1, cond2)        // Ready when ANY condition is ready
conditions.not(cond)                // Inverts a condition
```

### Configuration Examples

**Network-Dependent Activity:**

```typescript
defineActivity({
  name: 'syncToServer',
  execute: async (ctx) => { /* ... */ },
  options: {
    startToCloseTimeout: 30000,
    retry: {
      maximumAttempts: 10,
      initialInterval: 5000,
      backoffCoefficient: 2,
      maximumInterval: 60000,
    },
    runWhen: conditions.whenConnected,
  },
});
```

**Time-Delayed Activity:**

```typescript
defineActivity({
  name: 'delayedCleanup',
  execute: async (ctx) => { /* ... */ },
  options: {
    runWhen: conditions.afterDelay(30000),  // Wait 30 seconds
  },
});
```

**Custom Conditional Logic:**

```typescript
defineActivity({
  name: 'batteryAwareSync',
  execute: async (ctx) => { /* ... */ },
  options: {
    runWhen: (ctx) => {
      if (!ctx.isConnected) {
        return { ready: false, reason: 'No network' };
      }
      if (ctx.batteryLevel < 0.2 && !ctx.input.urgent) {
        return { ready: false, reason: 'Battery low, deferring non-urgent work' };
      }
      return { ready: true };
    },
  },
});
```

**Combined Conditions:**

```typescript
options: {
  runWhen: conditions.all(
    conditions.whenConnected,
    conditions.afterDelay(5000)
  ),
}
```

---

## State Threading

Activities receive accumulated state and return additions to it. This is how data flows through a workflow.

### How State Flows

```typescript
// Starting workflow
await engine.start(photoWorkflow, {
  input: { moveId: 123, uri: 'file://photo.jpg' },
});

// Initial state = input
// { moveId: 123, uri: 'file://photo.jpg' }
```

```typescript
// Activity 1: capturePhoto
execute: async (ctx) => {
  const { uri } = ctx.input;  // { moveId: 123, uri: '...' }
  const hash = await generateHash(uri);
  return { hash };  // Added to state
}

// State after: { moveId: 123, uri: '...', hash: 'abc123' }
```

```typescript
// Activity 2: uploadPhoto
execute: async (ctx) => {
  const { uri, hash } = ctx.input;  // { moveId: 123, uri: '...', hash: 'abc123' }
  const s3Key = await upload(uri);
  return { s3Key, uploadedAt: Date.now() };  // Added to state
}

// State after: { moveId: 123, uri: '...', hash: 'abc123', s3Key: '...', uploadedAt: ... }
```

```typescript
// Activity 3: notifyServer
execute: async (ctx) => {
  const { moveId, s3Key } = ctx.input;  // Full accumulated state
  await api.post(`/moves/${moveId}/photos`, { s3Key });
  // No return - nothing to add
}

// Final state: { moveId: 123, uri: '...', hash: 'abc123', s3Key: '...', uploadedAt: ... }
```

### State Merge Behavior

- Activity return values are **shallow merged** into state
- Return `undefined` or nothing to add nothing
- Later activities can overwrite earlier values (same key)
- Original input is preserved in `execution.input`
- Accumulated state lives in `execution.state`

     │         ┌───────────┐
     └────────▶│  FAILED   │
               └───────────┘
```

### Automatic Activity Advancement

When an activity completes successfully, the engine automatically advances to the next activity:

```typescript
async function onActivityCompleted(task: ActivityTask, result: object) {
  const execution = await storage.getExecution(task.runId);
  const workflow = workflowRegistry.get(execution.workflowName);

  // Merge activity result into workflow state
  const newState = { ...execution.state, ...result };

  // Check if this was the last activity
  const nextIndex = execution.currentActivityIndex + 1;
  const isComplete = nextIndex >= workflow.activities.length;

  if (isComplete) {
    // Mark workflow as completed
    await storage.saveExecution({
      ...execution,
      state: newState,
      status: 'completed',
      completedAt: Date.now(),
    });

    // Release uniqueness constraint
    if (execution.uniqueKey) {
      await storage.deleteUniqueKey(execution.workflowName, execution.uniqueKey);
    }

    // Invoke completion callback
    await workflow.onComplete?.(execution.runId, newState);
  } else {
    // Schedule next activity
    const nextActivity = workflow.activities[nextIndex];

    await storage.saveExecution({
      ...execution,
      state: newState,
      currentActivityIndex: nextIndex,
      currentActivityName: nextActivity.name,
    });

    await scheduleActivityTask({
      runId: execution.runId,
      activityName: nextActivity.name,
      input: newState,
      options: nextActivity.options,
    });
  }
}
```

---

## Cancellation

### Cancelling a Workflow

```typescript
await engine.cancelExecution(runId);
```

This triggers:

1. **WorkflowExecution** status set to `cancelled`
2. **Active activities** receive abort signal, status set to `cancelled`
3. **Pending activities** for this execution are removed
4. **Uniqueness key** (if any) is released
5. **onCancelled** callback invoked

### Handling Cancellation in Activities

The `signal` in ActivityContext is an `AbortSignal` that fires when the workflow is cancelled or the activity times out:

```typescript
execute: async (ctx) => {
  const { signal, input } = ctx;

  // Option 1: Pass signal to fetch (automatic abort)
  const response = await fetch(url, { signal });

  // Option 2: Check signal manually for long operations
  for (const item of input.items) {
    if (signal.aborted) {
      throw new Error('Activity cancelled');
    }
    await processItem(item);
  }

  // Option 3: Listen for abort event
  signal.addEventListener('abort', () => {
    cleanup();
  });
}
```

### Cancellation Guarantees

- **Best-effort**: If an activity is mid-execution, it may complete before seeing the abort signal
- **No rollback**: Completed activities are not undone; design activities to be idempotent
- **Immediate for pending**: Pending activities are removed without execution

---

## Dead Letter Queue

When an activity permanently fails (exhausts all retries), it's moved to the dead letter queue for inspection and potential manual intervention.

### Dead Letter Record Schema

```typescript
interface DeadLetterRecord {
  id: string;
  runId: string;                    // Original workflow execution
  taskId: string;                   // Failed activity task
  activityName: string;
  workflowName: string;
  input: object;                    // Activity input at time of failure
  error: string;                    // Final error message
  errorStack?: string;
  attempts: number;                 // How many attempts were made
  failedAt: number;                 // Timestamp of final failure
  acknowledged: boolean;            // Has this been reviewed/handled?
}
```

### Dead Letter API

```typescript
// Get all dead letters
const deadLetters = await engine.getDeadLetters();

// Get unacknowledged dead letters (not yet reviewed)
const unacked = await engine.getUnacknowledgedDeadLetters();

// Acknowledge after reviewing/handling
await engine.acknowledgeDeadLetter(id);

// Purge old acknowledged dead letters
await engine.purgeDeadLetters({
  olderThanMs: 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000,  // 7 days
  acknowledgedOnly: true,
});
```

### Automatic Cleanup

Configure automatic cleanup when creating the engine:

```typescript
const engine = await WorkflowEngine.create({
  storage: new MMKVStorageAdapter(),

  cleanup: {
    onStart: true,  // Run cleanup on engine start
    completedExecutionRetention: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000,    // 24 hours
    deadLetterRetention: 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000,        // 7 days

    onExecutionPurged: async (execution) => {
      console.log(`Purged execution ${execution.runId}`);
    },
    onDeadLetterPurged: async (record) => {
      console.log(`Purged dead letter ${record.id}`);
    },
  },
});
```

---

## Storage Backends

### Storage Adapter Interface

The engine uses a pluggable storage backend. Implement this interface for custom storage:

```typescript
interface StorageAdapter {
  // Workflow Executions
  saveExecution(execution: WorkflowExecution): Promise<void>;
  getExecution(runId: string): Promise<WorkflowExecution | null>;
  getExecutionsByStatus(status: WorkflowExecutionStatus): Promise<WorkflowExecution[]>;
  deleteExecution(runId: string): Promise<void>;

  // Uniqueness
  setUniqueKey(workflowName: string, key: string, runId: string): Promise<boolean>;
  getUniqueKey(workflowName: string, key: string): Promise<string | null>;
  deleteUniqueKey(workflowName: string, key: string): Promise<void>;

  // Activity Tasks
  saveActivityTask(task: ActivityTask): Promise<void>;
  getActivityTask(taskId: string): Promise<ActivityTask | null>;
  getActivityTasksForExecution(runId: string): Promise<ActivityTask[]>;
  getActivityTasksByStatus(status: ActivityTaskStatus): Promise<ActivityTask[]>;
  deleteActivityTask(taskId: string): Promise<void>;

  // Queue Operations
  getPendingActivityTasks(options?: { limit?: number }): Promise<ActivityTask[]>;
  claimActivityTask(taskId: string): Promise<ActivityTask | null>;

  // Dead Letter Queue
  saveDeadLetter(record: DeadLetterRecord): Promise<void>;
  getDeadLetters(): Promise<DeadLetterRecord[]>;
  getUnacknowledgedDeadLetters(): Promise<DeadLetterRecord[]>;
  acknowledgeDeadLetter(id: string): Promise<void>;
  deleteDeadLetter(id: string): Promise<void>;

  // Maintenance
  purgeExecutions(options: { olderThanMs: number; status: WorkflowExecutionStatus[] }): Promise<number>;
  purgeDeadLetters(options: { olderThanMs: number; acknowledgedOnly?: boolean }): Promise<number>;

  // Reactivity (optional)
  subscribe?(callback: (change: StorageChange) => void): () => void;
}
```

### MMKV Storage (Recommended)

MMKV is the recommended storage backend for most use cases:

```typescript
import { MMKVStorageAdapter } from 'react-native-workflow';

const engine = await WorkflowEngine.create({
  storage: new MMKVStorageAdapter({ id: 'my-app-workflows' }),
});
```

**Key Structure:**

```
executions:{runId}                      → WorkflowExecution object
unique:{workflowName}:{uniqueKey}       → runId
tasks:{taskId}                          → ActivityTask object
index:executions:status:{status}        → [runId1, runId2, ...]
index:tasks:status:pending              → [taskId1, taskId2, ...]
index:tasks:execution:{runId}           → [taskId1, taskId2, ...]
deadletter:{id}                         → DeadLetterRecord
index:deadletter:unacked                → [id1, id2, ...]
meta:stats                              → { totalExecutions, completed, failed, ... }
```

### Storage Backend Comparison

| Feature | MMKV | SQLite | Realm |
|---------|------|--------|-------|
| Setup complexity | Low | Medium | High |
| Query flexibility | Low (manual indexes) | High (SQL) | Medium |
| Reactivity | Built-in hooks | Manual | Built-in |
| Atomic transactions | No | Yes | Yes |
| Performance (simple ops) | Excellent | Good | Good |
| Performance (complex queries) | Poor | Excellent | Good |
| Bundle size impact | Small | Medium | Large |
| Maintenance status | Active | Active | Uncertain |

### Choosing a Backend

**Start with MMKV** for most use cases:
- Simplest setup and maintenance
- Excellent React hooks integration (`useMMKVObject`, etc.)
- Sufficient for < 1000 pending activities
- Smallest bundle size

**Consider SQLite** if you need:
- Complex queries
- Larger queue sizes (> 5000 activities)
- Strong consistency guarantees

## Background Processing

### Integration with OS Background Systems

iOS and Android limit background execution to approximately 30 seconds. The engine supports lifespan-aware execution:

```typescript
// background.ts
import * as TaskManager from 'expo-task-manager';
import * as BackgroundFetch from 'expo-background-fetch';

const BACKGROUND_TASK_NAME = 'WORKFLOW_ENGINE_BACKGROUND';

TaskManager.defineTask(BACKGROUND_TASK_NAME, async () => {
  console.log('Background task starting...');

  try {
    const engine = await WorkflowEngine.create({
      storage: new MMKVStorageAdapter(),
      runtimeContext: () => ({
        isConnected: getNetworkState(),
      }),
    });

    // Re-register all workflows (required in background context)
    engine.registerWorkflow(photoWorkflow);
    engine.registerWorkflow(driverStatusSyncWorkflow);

    // Process for limited time (OS limit ~30s, leave buffer)
    await engine.start({ lifespan: 25000 });

    return BackgroundFetch.BackgroundFetchResult.NewData;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Background task failed:', error);
    return BackgroundFetch.BackgroundFetchResult.Failed;
  }
});

export async function registerBackgroundProcessing() {
  await BackgroundFetch.registerTaskAsync(BACKGROUND_TASK_NAME, {
    minimumInterval: 60 * 15,       // Every 15 minutes
    stopOnTerminate: false,         // Keep running after app termination (Android)
    startOnBoot: true,              // Start on device boot (Android)
  });
}
```

### Lifespan-Aware Execution

When started with a lifespan, the engine will stop gracefully before the deadline:

```typescript
engine.start({ lifespan: 25000 });  // Process for max 25 seconds
```

The engine will:
- Stop 500ms before the deadline to allow graceful shutdown
- Only start activities that have enough time to complete (based on timeout)
- Skip activities that would exceed the remaining time

---

## React Hooks & Observability

### Built-in Hooks

```typescript
import {
  useExecution,
  useExecutionStats,
  usePendingActivities,
  useDeadLetters
} from 'react-native-workflow';

// Subscribe to a specific workflow execution
function MyComponent({ runId }) {
  const execution = useExecution(runId);

  if (!execution) return <Text>Loading...</Text>;

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Status: {execution.status}</Text>
      <Text>Current: {execution.currentActivityName}</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

// Aggregate statistics
function DashboardStats() {
  const stats = useExecutionStats();

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Running: {stats.running}</Text>
      <Text>Completed: {stats.completed}</Text>
      <Text>Failed: {stats.failed}</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

// Pending activities (for debugging)
function PendingList() {
  const tasks = usePendingActivities();

  return (
    <FlatList
      data={tasks}
      renderItem={({ item }) => (
        <Text>{item.activityName} - {item.status}</Text>
      )}
    />
  );
}

// Monitor failures
function FailureAlerts() {
  const deadLetters = useDeadLetters();

  if (deadLetters.length === 0) return null;

  return (
    <View style={styles.alert}>
      <Text>{deadLetters.length} workflows need attention</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```

### Workflow Progress Component

```tsx
function WorkflowProgress({ runId }: { runId: string }) {
  const execution = useExecution(runId);

  if (!execution) return <Text>Loading...</Text>;

  const workflow = workflowRegistry.get(execution.workflowName);
  const totalActivities = workflow.activities.length;
  const currentIndex = execution.currentActivityIndex;

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{execution.workflowName}</Text>
      <Text>Status: {execution.status}</Text>
      <Text>Progress: {currentIndex + 1} / {totalActivities}</Text>
      <Text>Current: {execution.currentActivityName}</Text>
      <ProgressBar value={(currentIndex + 1) / totalActivities} />

      {execution.status === 'failed' && (
        <Text style={{ color: 'red' }}>
          Failed at: {execution.failedActivityName}
          Error: {execution.error}
        </Text>
      )}
    </View>
  );
}
```

### Logging Configuration

```typescript
const engine = await WorkflowEngine.create({
  storage: new MMKVStorageAdapter(),

  logger: {
    debug: (msg, meta) => console.debug(`[Workflow] ${msg}`, meta),
    info: (msg, meta) => console.info(`[Workflow] ${msg}`, meta),
    warn: (msg, meta) => console.warn(`[Workflow] ${msg}`, meta),
    error: (msg, meta) => console.error(`[Workflow] ${msg}`, meta),
  },

  onEvent: (event) => {
    // Send to analytics, crash reporting, etc.
    switch (event.type) {
      case 'execution:started':
      case 'execution:completed':
      case 'execution:failed':
      case 'activity:started':
      case 'activity:completed':
      case 'activity:failed':
        analytics.track(event.type, event);
        break;
    }
  },
});
```

## Migration Guide

### From HopDrive react-native-queue Fork

If you're migrating from the HopDrive pipeline pattern:

#### Terminology Mapping

| Old (HopDrive) | New (This Library) |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Pipeline | Workflow |
| Event | WorkflowExecution |
| eventId | runId |
| Job | ActivityTask (internal) |
| Worker (function) | Activity |
| Worker options | ActivityOptions |
| `completeStage()` | *(automatic)* |

#### Phase 1: Parallel Implementation

Run both systems side-by-side with a feature flag:

```typescript
if (featureFlags.useNewWorkflowEngine) {
  await engine.start(photoWorkflow, { input: payload });
} else {
  await startPhotoPipeline({ payload });
}
```

#### Phase 2: Migrate Definitions

**Before (Pipeline + Workers):**

```typescript
// pipeline definition
export const name = 'photo.pipeline';
export const sequence = [PhotoCapture, PhotoPending, PhotoUpload, PhotoSave];

// PhotoCapture.worker.ts
export const worker = async (id, payload) => {
  const { eventId, uri } = payload;
  const hash = await generateHash(uri);
  await EventUtils.completeStage(pipeline, eventId, { hash });
};
```

**After (Workflow + Activities):**

```typescript
// workflow definition
export const photoWorkflow = defineWorkflow({
  name: 'photo',
  activities: [capturePhoto, pendingPhoto, uploadPhoto, savePhoto],
});

// capturePhoto.ts
export const capturePhoto = defineActivity({
  name: 'capturePhoto',
  execute: async (ctx) => {
    const { uri } = ctx.input;
    const hash = await generateHash(uri);
    return { hash };  // Automatic advancement, no completeStage()
  },
});
```

#### Phase 3: Data Migration

Migrate in-flight events to workflow executions:

```typescript
async function migrateInFlightEvents() {
  const events = await realm.objects('Event').filtered('syncStatus != "synced"');

  for (const event of events) {
    const execution: WorkflowExecution = {
      runId: event.eventId,
      workflowName: event.type,
      currentActivityIndex: getActivityIndex(event.stage),
      currentActivityName: event.stageName,
      status: mapStatus(event.syncStatus),
      input: event.payload,
      state: event.payload,
      createdAt: event.createdAt.getTime(),
      updatedAt: event.updatedAt.getTime(),
    };

    await newStorage.saveExecution(execution);
  }
}
```

#### Phase 4: Deprecation

1. Remove feature flags
2. Remove old queue library dependency
3. Clean up compatibility layers

---

## File Organization

### Recommended Structure

```
/workflows
  /photo
    capturePhoto.ts       # Activity definition
    uploadPhoto.ts        # Activity definition
    notifyServer.ts       # Activity definition
    activities.ts         # Barrel export of all activities
    workflow.ts           # Workflow definition
    index.ts              # Public export
  /driverStatusSync
    syncStatus.ts
    activities.ts
    workflow.ts
    index.ts
  /moveStatusSync
    ...
```

### Activity Definition

One file per activity, bundling the execute function with its options:

```typescript
// workflows/photo/uploadPhoto.ts
import { defineActivity, conditions } from 'react-native-workflow';

export const uploadPhoto = defineActivity({
  name: 'uploadPhoto',

  execute: async (ctx) => {
    const { uri, hash } = ctx.input;
    const response = await uploadToS3(uri, { signal: ctx.signal });
    return { s3Key: response.key, uploadedAt: Date.now() };
  },

  options: {
    startToCloseTimeout: 60000,
    retry: {
      maximumAttempts: 10,
      initialInterval: 5000,
      backoffCoefficient: 2,
      maximumInterval: 60000,
    },
    runWhen: conditions.whenConnected,
  },
});
```

### Activity Barrel Export

```typescript
// workflows/photo/activities.ts
export { capturePhoto } from './capturePhoto';
export { uploadPhoto } from './uploadPhoto';
export { notifyServer } from './notifyServer';
```

### Workflow Definition

```typescript
// workflows/photo/workflow.ts
import { defineWorkflow } from 'react-native-workflow';
import { capturePhoto, uploadPhoto, notifyServer } from './activities';

export const photoWorkflow = defineWorkflow({
  name: 'photo',
  activities: [capturePhoto, uploadPhoto, notifyServer],

  onComplete: async (runId, finalState) => {
    console.log(`Photo workflow ${runId} completed`);
  },
});
```

### Public Export

```typescript
// workflows/photo/index.ts
export { photoWorkflow } from './workflow';
export * from './activities';  // If activities need to be used elsewhere
```

---

## Testing

### Unit Tests

The library includes comprehensive unit tests for core functionality:

```typescript
describe('WorkflowEngine', () => {
  it('should execute activities in sequence', async () => {
    const workflow = defineWorkflow({
      name: 'test',
      activities: [activityA, activityB, activityC],
    });

    const execution = await engine.start(workflow, { input: { value: 1 } });
    await waitForCompletion(execution.runId);

    const result = await engine.getExecution(execution.runId);
    expect(result.status).toBe('completed');
    expect(result.state).toEqual({ value: 1, a: true, b: true, c: true });
  });
});
```

### Integration Tests

Test complete workflow scenarios:

```typescript
describe('Photo Pipeline Integration', () => {
  it('should upload photo when connected', async () => {
    // Setup
    mockNetworkState(true);

    // Execute
    const execution = await engine.start(photoWorkflow, {
      input: { uri: 'file://test.jpg', moveId: 123 },
    });

    // Wait and verify
    await waitForCompletion(execution.runId);
    expect(mockUploadApi).toHaveBeenCalled();
    expect(mockNotifyApi).toHaveBeenCalledWith({ moveId: 123, s3Key: expect.any(String) });
  });

  it('should defer upload when offline', async () => {
    mockNetworkState(false);

    const execution = await engine.start(photoWorkflow, {
      input: { uri: 'file://test.jpg', moveId: 123 },
    });

    // First activity completes, upload is pending
    await advanceTimers(1000);
    const state = await engine.getExecution(execution.runId);
    expect(state.currentActivityName).toBe('uploadPhoto');
    expect(state.status).toBe('running');

    // Come back online
    mockNetworkState(true);
    await advanceTimers(1000);

    // Now completes
    await waitForCompletion(execution.runId);
    expect(mockUploadApi).toHaveBeenCalled();
  });
});
```

### Storage Adapter Tests

Each storage adapter should pass the same test suite:

```typescript
describe.each([
  ['MMKV', new MMKVStorageAdapter()],
  ['SQLite', new SQLiteStorageAdapter()],
])('%s Storage Adapter', (name, adapter) => {

## Open Questions

These are architectural decisions that may evolve:

### Activity Dependencies / Parallel Execution

Current design is strictly sequential. Would parallel activity execution add value?

```typescript
// Possible future API
const workflow = defineWorkflow({
  name: 'multiUpload',
  activities: [
    prepare,
    parallel([uploadPhoto1, uploadPhoto2, uploadPhoto3]),  // Run in parallel
    notifyServer,
  ],
});
```

### Error Boundaries

How should errors in lifecycle callbacks (onComplete, onFailed) be handled? Should callback failures affect execution status?

### Storage Atomicity

MMKV lacks transactions. Should we implement write-ahead logging for multi-key operations to prevent inconsistent state on crashes?

### Testing Strategy

How to test workflows without actual activity execution? Mock storage adapter? Activity injection?

---

## Future Considerations

### Metadata Indexing

Current implementation only retrieves WorkflowExecutions by `runId`. If querying by business entity becomes necessary:

```typescript
// Possible future API
const executions = await engine.getExecutionsByMetadata({ moveId: 123 });
```

### Scheduled / Cron Workflows

```typescript
// Possible future API
await engine.schedule(cleanupWorkflow, {
  cron: '0 3 * * *',  // Daily at 3am
  input: { maxAge: 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 },
});
```

**Current recommendation**: Use OS-level schedulers (AlarmManager, BGTaskScheduler) to trigger workflows.

### Saga Pattern / Compensation

For workflows where failed activities need to "undo" previous activities:

```typescript
// Possible future API
const paymentWorkflow = defineWorkflow({
  name: 'payment',
  activities: [
    { activity: reserveInventory, compensate: releaseInventory },
    { activity: chargeCard, compensate: refundCard },
    { activity: sendConfirmation },
  ],
});
```

**Not recommended for v1**—adds significant complexity.

### True Background Threading

React Native's new architecture may enable running activities on separate threads:

```typescript
// Possible future API
defineActivity({
  name: 'processImage',
  execute: async (ctx) => { /* heavy computation */ },
  options: {
    runOnThread: true,
  },
});
```

Current activities are mostly I/O-bound where async concurrency is sufficient.
